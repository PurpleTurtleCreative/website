Code Syntax Block plugin extends the block editor by adding syntax highlighting to the core code block.

== Description ==

Code Syntax Block extends the WordPress block editor by adding syntax highlighting support to the core code block using the Prism syntax highlighter.

The Prism syntax highlighter runs JavaScript loaded on the front-end to parse code blocks and apply syntax markup. A CSS file specifies the color and style to apply to that markup.  See [Prism syntax highlighter](https://prismjs.com) for full details.

Primary development and issues tracked on Github at: [https://github.com/mkaz/code-syntax-block](https://github.com/mkaz/code-syntax-block)

== Installation ==

After installing and activating the plugin, use in the Block Editor by creating a standard code block and selecting a language format.

When creating a new code block, select Code block, and then in the Inspector (Block Controls on the Right) select the language for the code. The code will not change within the editor, but you'll see a small label with the selected language.

On the front-end when the post is being viewed, the code will be color syntax highlighted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What languages are supported? =

The Code Syntax Block plugin uses the Prism autoloader plugin to support all of the languages Prism supports. See the [list of supported languages here](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).


= How to customize the color scheme? =

The default color theme is [A11y Dark](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/themes/prism-a11y-dark.css) optimized for accessibility. If you want to change the colorscheme, you can select from the plugin settings page a few different themes shipped with the plugin. You can also use a theme from the [Prism themes repo](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) or create your own.

The color theme is a single CSS file, there are a couple ways to customize:

1. The plugin will check the current theme for the file: `assets/prism/prism.css` and use that file if it exists. Add your custom file in that location, and it will be used.

2. If you do not like that file location, you can use the filter `mkaz_prism_css_path` and specify a path relative to your theme to use.

3. If you would prefer specifying a full URL, you can use the filter `mkaz_prism_css_url` and specify a full URL to the stylesheet to use.

An example adding a filter to change the URL, add the following to your theme's function.php

	add_filter( 'mkaz_prism_css_url', function() {
		return 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/master/themes/prism-hopscotch.css';
});

Note: if you use the title/filename feature and customize the CSS, you will need to apply your own style targeting the prism-titlename class.


= How to customize the language list? =

Use the filter `mkaz_code_syntax_language_list` to customize the list of languages to select displayed in the editor. By default the code syntax block shows a shorter list of popular languages, but Prism supports close to 200, [see list](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).

Use this filter to extend to support the languages you need. Additionally you can use the filter to shorten the list to just the languages you use to make it easier to select.

Here is an example shortening the list to a smaller set:

    add_filter( 'mkaz_code_syntax_language_list', function() {
        return array(
            "bash" => "Bash",
            "go" => "Go",
            "html" => "HTML",
            "javascript" => "JavaScript",
            "json" => "JSON",
            "markdown" => "Markdown",
            "php" => "PHP",
            "python" => "Python",
            "jsx" => "React JSX",
            "sass" => "Sass",
            "sql" => "SQL",
            "svg" => "SVG",
            "toml" => "TOML",
            "vim" => "vim",
            "xml" => "XML",
            "yaml" => "YAML",
        );
    } );

= Can I set a default language so I don't have to select each time? =

Yes, on the plugin settings page in the dashboard you can set a default language when inserting a code block. You can still change if you wish to show code not using the default language.

= Can I override the conditional loading, so assets always load? =

Yes, use the filter `mkaz_code_syntax_force_loading` to force always loading assets, otherwise it users has_block to check.

Example:

	add_filter( 'mkaz_code_syntax_force_loading', '__return_true' );
