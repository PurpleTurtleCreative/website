== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes plugin vulnerabilities so dangerous? =
A worrisome website hacking statistic is that well over 90% of WordPress vulnerabilities are related to plugins or themes. One report found that as much as 98% of WordPress vulnerabilities are due to plugins while another study reported that 95% of vulnerabilities were because of plugins and themes.
To be secure, you should always keep WordPress plugins, themes, and core updated and monitored. Ensure you are always aware of the plugins youâ€™re using on your websites and always remove the ones you are not using.
When it comes to WordPress security plugins, we first recommend you get a better understanding of the WordPress security ecosystem and how they work.

= How will I be alerted if I have a vulnerability on my site? =
With the Patchstack Community (free) version, you can set up alerts using email (Slack notifications are available in the Developer plan). 

= What is Patchstack Incident Response? =
We offer **Incident Response which will cover the sites on all occasions (even if the site was not directly attacked).**

The add-on can possibly help you save tons of money when something happens. It costs $9 per site/month. **Enable Incident Response on your website [here](https://app.patchstack.com/addons).**

= Does Patchstack conflict with any other security plugins? =
We have not had issues with Patchstack conflicting with other security services, but we do recommend using as few different tools on your WordPress site as possible. If you do use another security plugin, it is recommended to not enable similar features as it could cause site-breaking issues. If you have any issues with other security tools, please contact our support so we could investigate the issue.

The paid version does run several tasks on each page load but based on tests from us and from our customers we have seen that Patchstack does not affect your website's performance in any significant or noticeable way.

= What if my site has already been hacked? =
Since Patchstack does not scan your files, it won't help you in finding malware on your website.

Our support is available only on live chat on our [website](https://patchstack.com)
