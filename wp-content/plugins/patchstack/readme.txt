Patchstack automatically identifies and mitigates security vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins, themes, and core.

== Description ==

Patchstack is a powerful tool that helps identify security vulnerabilities within your websites' plugins, themes, and WordPress core. It is powered by the WordPress ecosystem’s most active community of ethical hackers. Patchstack is trusted by leading WordPress experts such as Pagely, Cloudways, GridPane, Plesk, and others!

Patchstack is a security plugin for WordPress that finds WP core, plugin and theme vulnerabilities in your websites. 

The free version includes up to 48-hour early warning for new vulnerabilities found by our security research community. It also allows you to automatically update vulnerable software, manage updates remotely, and get snapshot reports on your sites’ security status.

The paid version includes automatic vulnerability protection. Patchstack deploys highly targeted rules on a per-site basis, only when a specific vulnerability is detected on a site.

This prevents vulnerable components from being exploited without modifying website code, or impacting site performance or functionality. Patchstack’s paid version includes access to 12,000+ individual protection rules (vPatches).

Patchstack paid version also includes other preventive security features, such as 2 factor authentication, WordPress specific hardening rules, a Community IP blocklist for malicious IP addresses, advanced security settings, and custom protection rules.

### Post-hack cleanups vs attack prevention in WordPress security
Unlike the standard approach to WordPress security (malware scanning and infection cleanups), Patchstack is focused on preventing infections in the first place.

Thanks to its big WordPress security research community and partnerships with nearly one thousand plugin vendors and developers, Patchstack is regularly among the first to identify new vulnerabilities.

### Who is Patchstack's WordPress security plugin for?
Patchstack’s vulnerability management works extremely well for:

* Agencies with WordPress care/maintenance plans for their customers’ websites
* WooCommerce websites to protect their revenue and customers from attacks
* Hosting companies that want to deliver highly targeted vulnerability protection easily and at scale
Website owners

You don’t have to be highly technical to use it. Install the plugin, connect it with the Patchstack App, and stay safe!

### What features are included in the Patchstack Personal (Free) plan?
Patchstack’s Personal plan is a free security service for WordPress that lets you find and manage vulnerabilities in your websites. It includes access to a central security dashboard via the Patchstack web App for more visibility and control over your sites’ security:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes plugin vulnerabilities so dangerous? =
A worrisome website hacking statistic is that well over 90% of WordPress vulnerabilities are related to plugins or themes. One report found that up to 98% of WordPress vulnerabilities are due to plugins, while another study reported that 95% were caused by plugins and themes.  
To stay secure, always keep your WordPress plugins, themes, and core updated and monitored. Be aware of which plugins you’re using and remove any that are no longer needed.  
When choosing a WordPress security plugin, it's important to understand how the WordPress security ecosystem works.  
Look for a tool that offers [vPatching](https://patchstack.com/articles/virtual-patching) (see [Patchstack’s features](https://patchstack.com/pricing)).
