== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes plugin vulnerabilities so dangerous? =
A worrisome website hacking statistic is that well over 90% of WordPress vulnerabilities are related to plugins or themes. One report found that as much as 98% of WordPress vulnerabilities are due to plugins while another study reported that 95% of vulnerabilities were because of plugins and themes.
To be secure, you should always keep WordPress plugins, themes, and core updated and monitored. Ensure you are always aware of the plugins youâ€™re using on your websites and always remove the ones you are not using.
When it comes to WordPress security plugins, we first recommend you get a better understanding of the WordPress security ecosystem and how they work.
Find one that can offer [vPatching](https://patchstack.com/articles/virtual-patching) ([check out Patchstack's features](https://patchstack.com/pricing)).
